/**
 * Passport Service
 *
 * A painless PassportService.js service for your Sails app that is guaranteed to
 * Rock Your Socks. It takes all the hassle out of setting up PassportService.js by
 * encapsulating all the boring stuff in two functions:
 *
 *   passport.endpoint()
 *   passport.callback()
 *
 * The former sets up an endpoint (/auth/:provider) for redirecting a user to a
 * third-party provider for authentication, while the latter sets up a callback
 * endpoint (/auth/:provider/callback) for receiving the response from the
 * third-party provider. All you have to do is define in the configuration which
 * third-party providers you'd like to support. It's that easy!
 *
 * Behind the scenes, the service stores all the data it needs within "Pass-
 * ports". These contain all the information required to associate a local user
 * with a profile from a third-party provider. This even holds true for the good
 * ol' password authentication scheme â€“ the Authentication Service takes care of
 * encrypting passwords and storing them in Passports, allowing you to keep your
 * User model free of bloat.

/**
 * Connect a third-party profile to a local user
 *
 * This is where most of the magic happens when a user is authenticating with a
 * third-party provider. What it does, is the following:
 *
 *   1. Given a provider and an identifier, find a matching PassportService.
 *   2. From here, the logic branches into two paths.
 *
 *     - A user is not currently logged in:
 *       1. If a Passport wassn't found, create a new user as well as a new
 *          Passport that will be assigned to the user.
 *       2. If a Passport was found, get the user associated with the passport.
 *
 *     - A user is currently logged in:
 *       1. If a Passport wasn't found, create a new Passport and associate it
 *          with the already logged in user (ie. "Connect")
 *       2. If a Passport was found, nothing needs to happen.
 *
 * As you can see, this function handles both "authentication" and "authori-
 * zation" at the same time. This is due to the fact that we pass in
 * `passReqToCallback: true` when loading the strategies, allowing us to look
 * for an existing session in the request and taking action based on that.
 *
